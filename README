CHANGES MADE: The focus of the refactoring was to implement the asnycio library in order to fix various vulnerabilities that arose from
multithreading (TOCTOU and PID). To do this threads and pipes were eliminated in favor of the async definitions. In its most basic form,
async defined functions are only able to run on one thread. By centralizing any threading into this library we can have a game that flows
simpler without all the overhead of using threads.

*** This refactor was done in PYTHON3 ***

You should just need to run...

sudo ./install.sh

...to get it installed.

After ./install is ran then python3, and all asyncio libraries should be installed as well.

To run server.py or client.py do "python3 server.py" or "python3 client.py

NOTE: MAKE SURE TO USE ./install because there are certain library dependencies that need to be fufilled.
